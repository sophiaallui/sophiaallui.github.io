## Introduction: 
**Hello!** My name is Sophia, and I am *currently* a fourth year studying Math-CS. 

Something that I learned during quarantine (not COVID-19 related)... 
> **You work as you're dying to afford the help you need in order to keep you alive ðŸ˜€ That's American health care system for you!!!**

Everyone must know this line of code: 
```
System.out.println("Hello, World!"); 
```
